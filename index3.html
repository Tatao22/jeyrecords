     <p> Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? 
        <br>
        Caught in a landside, 
        <br>
        No escape from reality Open your eyes, Look up to the skies and see,
        <br>
         I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy, Because I'm easy come, easy go,
         <br>
          Little high, little low, Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to Me, to me Mamaaa,
          <br> 
          Just killed a man, Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, Now he's dead Mamaaa,
          <br> 
          life had just begun, But now I've gone and thrown it all away Mama, oooh, Didn't mean to make you cry,
          <br>
           If I'm not back again this time tomorrow, Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters Too late,
           <br>
            my time has come, Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all The time Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,
            <br>
             Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth Mama, oooh I don't want to die, I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all. 
             <br>
             I see a little silhouetto of a man, Scaramouch, Scaramouch, will you do the Fandango! Thunderbolts and lightning,
             <br>
              very, very frightening me Galileo, Galileo Galileo, Galileo Galileo, Figaro - magnificoo I'm just a poor boy nobody 
              <br>
              loves me He's just a poor boy from a poor family, Spare him his life from this monstrosity Easy come, easy go, 
              <br>
              will you let me go Bismillah! No, we will not let you go (Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go (Let him go!)
              <br>
               Bismillah! We will not let you go (Let me go) Will not let you go (Let me go)(Never) Never let you go
               <br>
                (Let me go) (Never) let you go (Let me go) Ah No, no, no, no, no, no, no Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia,
                <br> 
                let me go Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, For meee So you think you can stop me and spit 
                <br>
                in my eye So you think you can love me and leave me to die Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby, Just gott
                <br>
                a get out, just gotta get right outta here Nothing really matters, Anyone can see, Nothing really matters,
                <br>
                 Nothing really matters to me Any way the wind blows...</p>
